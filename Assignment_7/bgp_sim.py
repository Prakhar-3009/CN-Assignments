bgp_sim.py

Simplified BGP path-vector simulation.

- Each node is an AS (autonomous system) identified by an integer AS number or string.
- Each AS may originate one or more prefixes (we model prefixes as 'P<ASN>' or custom strings).
- ASes exchange UPDATEs containing AS-paths to prefixes.
- Route selection: shortest AS-path (fewer AS hops). Tie-breaker: lexicographically smaller path.
- Loop prevention: a router rejects any advertised path containing its own AS.
- Convergence: when a full round causes no route changes.
